            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <h2>UNA Master Exam Schedule</h2>
            <p class="skills">
                Python
            </p>
            <p>Working with a team of five, our project was to develop a graphical program that calculated, based on previous
            semester data, the times for final exams. I helped develop the user experience and GUI for the project as well as
            aided in programming integration between the frontend and backend. We developed the GUI using wxPython, a graphical
            toolkit based on wxWidgets for Python.</p>

            <h2>Alabama Geographic Alliance Website</h2>
            <p class="skills">
                HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP
            </p>
            <p>The Alabama Geographic Alliance website was developed to keep members up-to-date with the latest events and news
            stories about geography education from kindergarten to collegiate institutions. The website was developed with a Wordpress
            backend and a customized CSS theme. Members can sign up for a newsletterdeveloped with Mailchimp. The website can be found
            at <a href="http://www.alabamageography.org" target="_blank">alabamageography.org.</a></p>

            <h2>Lexical Analyzer & Parser</h2>
            <p class="skills">
                C++
            </p>
            <p>This was a project from Automata Theory and Compiler Construction, in which we created the starting foundations of
            a compiler. Namely, I created the scanner that reads in code, character by character, and stores them in a hashing table. This
            is later used for the parser that implements a grammar to see if it is a legal sentence in the language. This scanner and
            parser detects the pseudo-language MINI-P, a miniaturized version of Pascal.</p>

            <h2>EmuMenu</h2>
            <p class="skills">
                Lua
            </p>
            <p>A self-directed project that was built with Lua and LOVE 2D 0.8. The goal of this project was to develop an easy-to-use GUI
            that can be navigated with a gamepad (or a keyboard) that allows me to pick an emulated video game to play from the comfort of
            my couch without having to use the complicated or time-consuming UI on emulators. It would automatically detect what system the
            game is for and call the appropriate emulator. When the emulator quits, the menu will pop back up.</p>

            <h2>Scheduler - School Course Calendar</h2>
            <p class="skills">
                Java
            </p>
            <p>A self-directed Android app. The purpose of this was to create a simple and easy way to assign (or delete) due dates, test dates,
            and any other time information for specific school classes or courses. Courses and events are managed in a SQLite table.</p>
